             as Subversion or Git to store control files.

           comment: |
             In Drupal 8, we must also match new paths where the '.php' appears in
             the middle, such as update.php/selection. The rule we use is strict,
             and only allows this pattern with the update.php front controller.
             This allows legacy path aliases in the form of
             blog/index.php/legacy-path to continue to route to Drupal nodes. If
             you do not have any paths like that, then you might prefer to use a
             laxer rule, such as:
               location ~ \.php(/|$) {
             The laxer rule will continue to work if Drupal uses this new URL
             pattern with front controllers other than update.php in a future
             release.
